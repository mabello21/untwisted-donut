## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Using of Flexbox and Grid properties


.flexbox-container {
	display: flex;
	flow-direction: row/column/reverse;
	...
	}
	
.grid-container {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: auto auto auto; //for 3 columns grid
	}


### Continued development

In future, I'd like to keep learning about flexbox and grid. So I could refine my projects.
